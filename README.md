# OHAKO-Prelude
A collection of useful Swift tools.

## Getting started

#### Carthage

If you use [Carthage][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
Prelude to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "OHAKO-Inc/OHAKO-Prelude"
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `Prelude.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.
